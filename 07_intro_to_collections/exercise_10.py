# Exercise 10
# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# This is a set, and sets are unordered.
# There is no guarantee it will print alphabetically.
