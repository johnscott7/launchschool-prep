# Exercise 1
# Use concatenation to create your full name. For example, if your name is John Doe, you should combine 'John' and 'Doe' to get 'John Doe'.
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Scott'
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

# or

full_name_2 = ('John' + ' ' + 'Scott')
print(full_name_2)
